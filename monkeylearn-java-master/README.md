# Java GUI for machine learning classfier

This classifier determines whether the input LLVM file contains merge sort or not. The goal of this project was to determine whether machine learning is able to interpret compiled machine code.

This Java GUI is built using [MonkeyLearn's API](https://github.com/monkeylearn/monkeylearn-java). We contructed the classifier itself using MonkeyLearn and collected our own data.
